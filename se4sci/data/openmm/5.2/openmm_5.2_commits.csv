(2) Changed erfc.cpp to a header file which defines missing erf() and erfc() as static functions when using VC++ but otherwise does nothing. (3) Replaced all nonstandard uses of real() and imag() methods as lvalues; instead work directly with the complex values. (4) Fixed a bug in TestFindExclusions which was caught by VC++'s extensive STL debug mode self-examination.
351563bWed Apr 22 21:14:30 2009 +0000Fixed a compilation error under Windows

(2) I disabled the block of code in the main CMakeLists file that tries to second guess VC++'s choices for runtime libraries. This was required for me to get CUDA to work in VC 2005 where the compiler always chooses multithreaded libraries. I verified that Brook will still build this way, but I haven't tested it.
