d3fd7d5,2014-05-21 14:41:29,Rewrite Amber inpcrd/restart file handling. Among the improvements:     - existence of velocities and box vectors is auto-detected  so       loadVelocities and loadBoxVectors are unnecessary     - recognizes NetCDF-format Amber restart files (which can be written by       tleap  sander  pmemd  and cpptraj).     - Restart files coordinate/velocity/box fields have a hard width of 12       characters and does not ensure that fields are whitespace delimited. This       commit will correctly parse (valid) Amber restart files in which a       particular coordinate is <= -100 A or >= 1000 A (not uncommon for restart       files from sander/pmemd).     - File format (ASCII vs. NetCDF) is auto-detected.,0

2b0962e,2014-05-29 23:10:00,Make separate lists for dihedrals and the dihedrals with loaded parameters.  The former has a single entry for all unique dihedrals. The latter has a separate entry for every _term_ of every dihedral (and the latter is the one with the parameters loaded into it). This way  parameter sets can be reloaded at will without relying on the hack that createSystem previously employed (i.e.  backing up the dihedral array  clobbering it  then putting it back). This way is cleaner and safer (although functionally equivalent for typical OpenMM use).,0

For large systems  this makes the tests run a lot faster (for small systems it's not a large speedup).,0
